Members in Computer Graphics:  
Alexander Phillips: A multi-faceted dev that has worked on various programming, design but mainly art contributions to the game.  
Ethan Zafra: Mainly a programmer that works on the game's gameplay scripts. In the previous semester, I've tried working on lighting to improve the level's visual appearance.  

Contribution for group assignment:
Alexander Phillips: 
Ethan Zafra: Enemy Decals and Texture Filtering.

Group Assignment explanation:\
Decals: Decals were added on top of the main enemy texture when a bool is true. A seperate script that is used for the enemy behavior turns on the bool when the enemy is damaged.\
Texture filtering: Used a 2x2 box filter that takes the average value of the nearest 2x2 pixels to determine the value for a pixel.
